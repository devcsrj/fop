/**
 * Welcome programmer!
 * <p>
 * This file serves as an FYI for using this project. When in doubt, read this
 * documentation again.
 * <p>
 * ==================================================================================
 * The directory structure of this project is as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  - src
 *    - main
 *      - java
 *        - ch0intro
 *        ...
 *    - test
 *      - java
 *        - ch0intro
 *        ...
 *  - pom.xml
 * </pre>
 * ==================================================================================
 * <p>
 * First thing to notice is the file `pom.xml`. This file is used for dependency management
 * by Maven. No need to worry about this for now, all it does is download the required JARs
 * for this project. JAR here stands for Java Archive, and is like a ZIP file but contains
 * Java .class files. Again, no need to worry about these for now, this simply serves as
 * a note in case you want to do some more research.
 * <p>
 * ==================================================================================
 * <p>
 * Notice that this class, "About" located under "src/main/java/ch0intro/About.java",
 * has a corresponding file called "src/test/java/ch0intro/AboutTest.java". This means that,
 * the class "AboutTest" is a test for the class "About". This same pattern is
 * applied across all classes.
 * <p>
 * Now, open "AboutTest"!

public class About {

    /**
     * @return The string "Hello, " plus the provided "name"
     */
    public String printHello(String name) {
        return null;
    }
}
